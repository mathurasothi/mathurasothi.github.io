								<h2>Hello World!</h2>
								<p>I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo. Recent cyber-attacks among several notable tech-companies have
									not only flagged the news media’s attention, but cost companies a record $3 million on average per security
									breach and it can take up to 280 days just to contain the breach. Therefore, it is important now more than
									ever to invest in quality people, writing quality code. I would love to have the opportunity to build and
									develop the code that keeps the world markets in motion, whether it is in a pandemic, a political conflict or in
									times of need. </p>
								<p>I have previously completed internships with BlackBerry, The Weather Network and KPMG LLP. I had the opportunity to
									design and implement Canada’s national Amber Alerting system, which has a shiny new React UI and
									required integrating RESTful APIs with microservices architecture. At BlackBerry, Canada's largest cyber security company,
									I was able to develop a team-wide CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and collect performance metrics of each service simultaneously.</p>
								<p>My experience covers a wide range of skills, some of which I hope 
									will be useful to your organization's needs. For a formal resume, please feel free to reach out to me via email.</p>
